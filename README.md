# **User Input Statistics API**
I challenged myself for this assignment to start from no prior code and create an API which talks to a database to accomplish the following tasks:
1. Create and delete users, along with appropriate error messages if user fails to save or if user is not in the database when trying to delete
2. Read all users
3. Calculate the total number of visits by users
4. Read the most recently logged on user
5. Read the user who was first to join

In addition, the User class has a corresponding test suite which confirms the user validations.
